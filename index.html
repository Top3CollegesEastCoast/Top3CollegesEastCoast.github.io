	<p>We know how tough deciding colleges can be. We check on the GPA requirement, acceptance rate, how much you have to score on SAT, and more importantly how much does it cost for a 4 year degree. So based on that here are the top 3 colleges on the east coast of the U.S with high graduation and acceptance rate.
	
	<p>Although these colleges are not as Ivy League ranked ones they are still pretty good, and they provide teaching quality similar to that of IVY League Universities, plus they are bit cheaper compared all the IVY's, and it's bit cheaper when it comes to tution and housing and food.</p>
